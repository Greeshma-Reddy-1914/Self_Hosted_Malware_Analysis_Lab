**Introduction:**

With the increasing threat of malware, having a solid defense strategy is crucial for safeguarding digital assets. Malware, like viruses and ransomware, can cause significant harm, from stealing sensitive information to disrupting operations. Traditional methods of detecting malware are often not enough to catch new and evolving threats, making dynamic analysis vital. This paper proposes creating a self-hosted malware analysis lab, providing a controlled environment to study and neutralize malware. Unlike relying solely on external services, hosting our analysis lab gives us more control and flexibility, which is essential for researchers and analysts. By building our lab, we can strengthen our cybersecurity defenses and better protect against emerging threats.
